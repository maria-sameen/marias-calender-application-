# marias-calender-application-


## Description

I wanted to create a calender where one can input events in their day. I applied knowledge that I learnt over the last week to successfully complete the task.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    md
    ![alt text](./Assets/Images/Picture2.png)
